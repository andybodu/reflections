When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other people, or perhaps when you work from different workstations. It's also a way to protect/backup files.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling automatically may risk losing work you're doing locally.
