What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository adds a .git folder to your directory, and allows git to store meta data on all files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a mid-way between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to be more selective in your commits - rather than just taking everything in the working directory, or else having to committ individual files. You can committ multiple files, without committing all.
