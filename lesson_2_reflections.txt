What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository adds a .git folder to your directory, and allows git to store meta data on all files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a mid-way between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to be more selective in your commits - rather than just taking everything in the working directory, or else having to committ individual files. You can committ multiple files, without committing all.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can choose what files to add to the staging area, and which to commit - so you can group together a number of files with a logical change, or a single file with a logical change.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When introducing experimental features, or variants on the main program. Branches allow you veer off, without affecting the main branch.
